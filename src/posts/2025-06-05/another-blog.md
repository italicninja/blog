# AI in the Workplace: My Personal Journey

Hey there! Welcome to my very first blog post. I'm actually using VS Code's voice dictation to write this markdown file, which feels pretty exciting. Today, I want to chat about how AI is shaking things up in my workspace and personal projects.

You know, there's this wild idea going around that AI should be used for literally everything – from parsing docs to writing code. It's crazy how fast things are changing! This shift got me thinking about how I could use AI in my own projects, and well, here we are with this blog.

Now, let me tell you a bit about what I do. My official title is Technology Architect, but really, I'm all about system administration and DevOps. I'm the guy who gets excited about automating and orchestrating system configurations. When I first started, I was all about Puppet. Man, I loved Puppet – it got me into this whole automation game. But let's face it, Ruby's getting a bit long in the tooth now.

So, we've been shaking things up at work. We're moving away from those legacy systems (you know, the ones running on CentOS 7 and Windows Server 2012 – yep, those oldies) and diving into more modern stuff. I'm talking Ansible, Terraform, Packer – the whole Hashicorp stack. It's been a fun ride, implementing this modern infrastructure-as-code approach.

And then AI entered the chat. Suddenly, I'm using it to convert all that Puppet code I've written over the years into Ansible. It's mind-blowing how fast AI can make these changes. Sure, it doesn't always get it right the first time (or even the second or third), but in our modern setup, we can test and iterate so quickly that it's not a big deal.

But wait, there's more! We're also building this private cloud infrastructure, and guess what? AI is helping us write the infrastructure code for that too. Now, don't get me wrong – we're not going full Skynet here. In healthcare, we can't exactly have a fully AI-enabled data center... at least not yet.

The coolest part? The speed at which AI can generate tests. As devs, we all know we should write more tests, but let's be honest, it's not always the most exciting part of the job. AI is filling that gap, and it's pretty awesome.

Oh, and I should mention – the idea for this blog setup came from Theo.gg on YouTube. I'll drop a link to his channel at the bottom of this post, along with another YouTuber, "Diary of a CEO," who covers some pretty interesting topics.

So there you have it – my journey with AI so far. It's been quite a ride, and I'm excited to see where it goes next. Who knows, maybe my next post will be entirely AI-generated... or maybe not. We'll see!
