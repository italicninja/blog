# Blog beauty tweaks

*June 7, 2025 - 10:53 AM*

So this morning I got up at, what, 4:00 AM PST? Yeah… pretty freaking early. But hey, early morning productivity hits different—it’s usually when I get my best work done.

Naturally, I spent the first three hours wrestling with AI, trying to get a database connection installed. There is a branch. There is a database. But the connection? Not what I actually want. So I’ll probably scrap that and redo it properly.

Instead, I pivoted and spent about 30 minutes chatting with AI and prompting some CSS changes for the site. Overall? The vibrancy feels a lot better now. The site has a nicer feel to it.

At one point, the AI tried to implement a dark/light mode toggle that completely broke everything. So I got very specific with the prompt: just update the CSS—nothing else. That did the trick. It’s looking much cleaner now.

I really like how the blog post section looks, and I’m happy with the current color scheme (even though I didn’t exactly choose it—AI kind of took the wheel there). I also added a few little tweaks to the blog page itself.

Still, there are more things I want to adjust on the main page. I’ll probably handle those in another branch later.

Unfortunately, since the database connection isn’t working yet, posting is still done via markdown. But hey, at least the styling’s coming together—and that includes this very blog post.

Keeping it short and to the point today. It’s gorgeous out. Hoping to take a walk, maybe play some games, and circle back to this tonight. Could be a two-post day.

Later days!
