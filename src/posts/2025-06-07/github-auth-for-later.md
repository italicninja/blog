# Github Auth for later

*June 6, 2025 - 9:43 PM*

So today I ran into the downside of writing blog posts in markdown files: you have to commit every single post. Which is... fine. But also kinda slow, especially when I don’t feel like doing all the usual git add ., git commit -m "new post", git push dance just to say I wrote a few paragraphs.

To fix that, I kicked off part one of a little three-part project. Step one? GitHub authentication.

Now that I’ve got GitHub auth working, I can log into the frontend with my account. The eventual goal here is to be able to write a post in a simple form on the site, hit submit, and have it go straight to a backend database—no git stuff involved. Just clean, quick, and painless.

Next steps:

    Build that blog post form

    Set up a backend to receive it

    Design the database schema and wire it all up

Once that’s all working, I can fully switch over to this setup for writing posts. I’ll migrate the current markdown posts at some point. Oh, and I need to do something about the images too. Might use uploadthing.com—Theo likes it, and it seems easy enough.

Anyway, short post today. Mostly just happy GitHub auth is working. I’m merging this into the main branch now, so this post will go live along with it.

Next up: the blog submission form. Stay tuned.

Anyway, later days!
