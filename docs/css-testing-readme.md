# CSS Testing and Regression Prevention

This document provides an overview of the CSS testing process and tools implemented for the blog project.

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive CSS testing and regression prevention system to ensure consistent styling across development and production environments. This system includes:

1. A detailed testing protocol
2. An automated regression testing script
3. Documentation of CSS implementation and findings
4. Fixes for identified issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the CSS regression tests, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm run test:css:setup
```

This will install:
- Puppeteer: For browser automation
- PixelMatch: For image comparison
- PNGjs: For image processing
- fs-extra: For file operations

### Running Tests

To run the CSS regression tests:

1. Start the development server on port 3000:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the production server on port 3001:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   PORT=3001 npm run start
   ```

3. Run the regression tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:css
   ```

4. View the results in the `test-results/css-regression` directory.

## Documentation

### CSS Testing Protocol

The [CSS Testing Protocol](./css-testing-protocol.md) outlines the manual testing process for ensuring consistent CSS rendering between development and production environments. It covers:

- Environment setup
- Visual comparison testing
- Responsive design testing
- Dark mode testing
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing
- CSS validation
- Regression testing checklist

### CSS Audit Findings

The [CSS Audit Findings](./css-audit-findings.md) document contains the results of our comprehensive CSS audit, including:

- CSS implementation analysis
- Environment comparison
- Responsive design assessment
- Browser compatibility issues
- Styling inconsistencies
- Optimization opportunities
- Accessibility considerations
- Recommended fixes

## Automated Testing

The `scripts/css-regression-test.js` script automates the process of comparing CSS rendering between development and production environments. It:

1. Takes screenshots of key pages in both environments
2. Compares the screenshots for visual differences
3. Generates a visual diff highlighting the differences
4. Creates an HTML report of the results

### Configuration

You can configure the test script by modifying the `config` object at the top of the file:

```javascript
const config = {
  devUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  prodUrl: 'http://localhost:3001',
  outputDir: path.join(__dirname, '../test-results/css-regression'),
  viewports: [
    { width: 375, height: 667, name: 'mobile' },
    { width: 768, height: 1024, name: 'tablet' },
    { width: 1440, height: 900, name: 'desktop' }
  ],
  pages: [
    { path: '/', name: 'home' },
    { path: '/blog', name: 'blog-listing' },
    { path: '/blog/blog-beauty-tweaks', name: 'blog-post' },
    { path: '/about', name: 'about' }
  ],
  components: [
    { selector: 'header', name: 'header' },
    { selector: 'footer', name: 'footer' },
    { selector: '.card', name: 'blog-card' }
  ]
};
```

## Best Practices

### CSS Implementation

1. Use CSS variables for consistent styling
2. Implement proper focus states for accessibility
3. Use responsive design patterns
4. Provide fallbacks for modern CSS features
5. Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Testing

1. Run regression tests before and after significant CSS changes
2. Test across multiple browsers and devices
3. Verify dark mode functionality
4. Check accessibility compliance
5. Document any issues found

## Continuous Integration

Consider integrating the CSS regression tests into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect styling regressions before deployment.

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: CSS Regression Tests

  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - '**.css'
      - '**.tsx'
      - '**.jsx'

jobs:
